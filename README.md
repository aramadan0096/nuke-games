# Nuke Games: A Fun Break for VFX Compositors

Welcome to **Nuke Games**! ðŸŽ® This repository is your ultimate escape from the intense world of VFX compositing. Take a break and enjoy some classic arcade games right inside Nuke. We've got three exciting games for you: **Arkanoid**, **Monster**, and **Nuke Tower**.

## Games Included

### Arkanoid
Break all the blocks with your ball and paddle. Move the paddle left and right to keep the ball in play and destroy all the blocks to win!

### Monster
Catch the good dots and avoid the bad ones! Move your player plate to collect the falling dots. White dots are good, black dots are bad. Miss a good dot or catch a bad one, and it's game over!

### Nuke Tower
Jump from platform to platform and climb as high as you can! Avoid falling off the screen and keep an eye on your score. The higher you go, the faster the platforms fall!
